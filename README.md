# Project Description：
This is a list of the main projects I have been involved in.


### **Cloud Disk**：
- Aimed to realize the foundational functions of the cloud disk such as file uploading and downloading. 
- Utilized C/S architecture to design client-server communication and implemented it using Python, enhancing transmission efficiency through concurrency and thread pool.
- Achieved a successful upload with an upload speed of 3.33Gbps.
### **Software Defined Network Project**：
- Aimed to create an SDN network topology to emulate a traffic control function through flow entry.
- Implemented the initialization of the SDN controller and forwarding rules using Python and Mininet.
- Accomplished the function of loading balancing based on SDN architecture. 
### **Database**:
- Created a database to record virus test results, personal information of infected patients, and travel records to assist the government in better controlling infectious diseases.
- Worked on SQL to divide different regions into high, medium, and low-risk levels based on the travel paths of infected individuals, and conduct screenings and testing for individuals in the same area. Additionally, sort hospital test report times and provide the current remaining bed count.
### **Web Scraping**:
- Aimed to scrap the information from a Quote Web.
- Utilize Python to scrape quote content, tags, and author information. Analyze the scraped data employing bar charts, histograms, box plots, scatter plots, pie charts, and heatmaps.

### **Predicting Healthcare Employee Attrition**:
- Aimed at utilizing machine learning and analytics to develop robust models, accurately predicting employee turnover rates is crucial for maintaining the stability and quality of healthcare services.
- Encompass various technological including data visualization, data preprocessing, data transformation, and predictive modeling.
- Achieve an accuracy of 96.8% using SVM and 92.8% using decision trees.
